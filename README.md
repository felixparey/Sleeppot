Sleepot is an iOS application that helps people with problems falling asleep. It uses on-device machine learning to analyse the problem the user seems to face and outputs a phrase that calms down the user and helps them clear their minds.

**How it works:**
 1. Tell Potty what bothers you 
 2. Wait for the repsonse
 3. Accept the answer to your problem or ask Potty for another solution
 4. Sleep well!
